<li> Explain how PrEP works in language that is easy to understand</li>
<li> Explain how PrEP works as part of a comprehensive prevention plan</li>
</ul>
<br />

<strong>Limitations of PrEP</strong>
<ul class="single">
<li> Efficacy is dependent on adherence</li>
<li> PrEP reduces but does not eliminate HIV transmission risk</li>
<li> PrEP does not protect against other STIs</li>
</ul>
<br />

<strong>PrEP use</strong>
<ul class="single">
<li> Dosing and need for daily adherence</li>
<li> Number of sequential doses to achieve protective effect<em><sup>a</sup></em></li>
<li> What to do when doses are missed, and reinforcement of condom use in period following missed dose</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Common side effects</strong>
<ul class="single">
<li> Headache, abdominal pain, weight loss; side effects usually resolve or improve after first month
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Long-term safety of PrEP<em><sup>b</sup></em></strong>
<ul class="single">
<li> 24-month follow-up data suggest clinical safety of oral TDF in non-HIV-infected individuals
</ul>

<br />
<strong>Baseline tests and schedule for monitoring</strong>
<ul class="single">
<li> Tests that need to be taken before prescribing PrEP (see 
<a href="step_info.jsp?info=inst7" data-inline="true" data-rel="dialog" data-transition="<%=transition%>" data-theme="c" class="recommendation">Table: Pre-Prescription: Laboratory Tests</a>)</li>

<a href="step_info.jsp?info=inst9" data-inline="true" data-rel="dialog" data-transition="<%=transition%>" data-theme="c" class="recommendation">Table: PrEP: Follow-Up Visits</a>), including HIV testing at least every 3 months
</ul><br />


<strong>Criteria for discontinuing PrEP</strong>
<ul class="single">
<li> Positive HIV test result: <strong>PrEP needs to be stopped immediately upon receipt of a positive HIV test result</strong></li>
<li> Development of renal disease</li>
<li> Use of medication for unintended purposes</li>
<li> Non-adherence to medication or appointments</li>
<li> Change in risk behaviors (ie, PrEP is no longer needed)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Possible symptoms of seroconversion</strong>
<ul class="single">
<li> Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience any of the following symptoms: fever, rash, joint pain, oral ulcers (mouth sores), fatigue, night sweats, sore throat, malaise, pain in muscles, loss of appetite

<td><strong>Benefits</strong>
<ul class="single">
<li> Decreased risk of acquisition of <a href="http://www.hivguidelines.org/?page_id=3499" target="_blank">acute HIV infection during pregnancy</a>, which is a significant risk factor for mother-to-child HIV transmission

<strong>Potential toxicity</strong>
<ul class="single">
<li> Available data suggest that TDF/FTC does not increase risk of birth defects; however, there are not enough data to exclude the possibility of harm</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em><u>Note</u>:</em></strong> For women who become pregnant while using PrEP, continuation of PrEP during pregnancy is an individualized decision based on whether there are ongoing risks for HIV during pregnancy</p></td>

 Based on modeling, 7 days of daily dosing is needed to achieve protective concentrations for receptive anal sex and 21 days of daily dosing is needed for receptive vaginal sex. There are no data for injection drug use or insertive vaginal or anal sex.</li>
<br /><sup><em>b</em></sup> Although long-term safety has not been established in non-HIV-infected individuals, TDF/FTC has been used safely in HIV-infected individuals since 2004. 24-month follow-up data show clinical safety of oral TDF in uninfected MSM
