<li>Drug-resistant HIV has been identified in patients with undetected HIV who subsequently received TDV/FTC for PrEP

<p><strong>Lack of readiness to adhere</strong> to a daily PrEP regimen is also a contraindication. Efficacy of PrEP is dependent on adherence to ensure that plasma drug levels reach a protective level.</p></td>
