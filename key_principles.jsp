<ul class="single">
<li><strong>PrEP should not be offered as a sole intervention</strong> for HIV prevention. PrEP should only be prescribed <strong>as part of a comprehensive prevention plan.</strong></li>
<p></p>
<li>PrEP may <strong>help protect the HIV seronegative partner in a serodiscordant relationship during attempts to conceive.</strong></li>
<p></p>
<li>PrEP is indicated for individuals who have <strong>a documented negative HIV test result</strong> and are at <strong>ongoing high risk for HIV infection.</strong> A negative HIV test result needs to be confirmed as close to initiation of PrEP as possible, ideally on the same day the prescription is given. <strong>Clinicians should wait to prescribe PrEP until confirmation of a negative test result is available.</strong></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Efficacy of PrEP is dependent on adherence.</strong> PrEP should only be prescribed to those who are able to adhere to the regimen and express a willingness to do so.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Although consistent condom use is a critical part of a prevention plan, <strong>lack of use of barrier protection is not a contraindication to PrEP.</strong></li>
<p></p>
<li>PrEP is contraindicated in individuals with <strong>documented HIV infection</strong> or <strong>creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min,</strong> and in <strong>those who are not ready to adhere to daily PrEP.</strong></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>The first prescription of PrEP</strong> (Truvada 1 tablet PO daily) <strong>should only be for 30 days</strong> to allow for a follow-up visit to assess adherence, tolerance, and commitment. At the 30-day visit, a prescription for 60 days may be given; the <strong>patient should then return for 3-month HIV testing</strong> and other assessments. After that visit, <strong>prescriptions can be given for 90 days, provided that the patient is adherent</strong>.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Patients receiving PrEP require <strong>regular visits, at least every 3 months, to monitor HIV status, adherence, and side effects</strong>. Follow-up and monitoring of patients receiving PrEP also includes prevention services that are part of a comprehensive prevention plan, such as risk-reduction counseling, access to condoms, STI screening, and mental health and substance use screening, when indicated.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Whenever patients present with <strong>symptoms of <a href="http://www.hivguidelines.org/clinical-guidelines/adults/diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-hiv-infection/" target="_blank">acute HIV infection</a>, an HIV serologic screening test should be used in conjunction with a plasma HIV RNA assay</strong>.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Discontinue PrEP immediately for patients who receive a positive HIV test result.</strong> Obtain a genotypic assay, and refer and link to HIV care.</li>
